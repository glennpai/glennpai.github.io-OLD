            <b>Here's some backstory to my inspiration to become a developer that you didn't ask for.</b>
            </br></br>
            Let's start from when I was a child. I grew up in the early 2000's playing video games
            as much as anyone could at the time. Throughout the years my GameBoy turned into a Nintendo 64.
            That N64 turned into a PlayStation Portable. The PSP into a PlayStation 2... I'll spare you the other 
            dozen consoles I've owned throughout the years and just say video games were a very significant 
            part of my life for as long as I can remember.
            </br></br>
            Some time around my first year of high school I started to realize I wanted to design and create 
            games like the ones I grew up playing. In the hundreds of games I played growing up, I always thought
            it was interesting to see all of the names at the end of the game in the credit sequence. I always dreamed 
            about seeing my own name roll by after someone beat a game I helped create. 
            </br></br>
            Fast forward to now. I'm a PC gaming, caffeine consuming, web app developing adult. I have found a 
            similar satisfaction in developing apps and scripts that are used in a professional setting. 
            Seeing things that I have made myself go out into the world and be used by real people still 
            gets my blood pumping. Though I have not yet quite made it to the original dream of being a 
            video game designer, the drive is still there in the form of passion projects and professional 
            application development. I still hope to some day see my name on that credit screen.
