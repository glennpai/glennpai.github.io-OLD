        <p>
            My name's Chris. I'm another twenty-something software engineer living life to the fullest.
            I've created this site to showcase some projects I have been working on as well as share some
            of my interests with the world.

            If you were wondering why this site looks like it was created in 1998, that's because it was entirely built
            using raw HTML and CSS as a learning experience. I intend to update the structure and design
            of this site as my design skills develop. If you're viewing this site on mobile... I'm sorry. I know the 
            mobile support for my styling is terrible. Try a landscape desktop browser for the full experience! :)
