# glenn-site

Personal website to showcase my projects and interests. Currently written entirely in raw HTML and CSS without any design frameworks. 

## TODO

- Add personal projects to project page
- Implement a design framework to make the site look like it was made in the last 20 years
- Improve navbar
- Create feedback form
- Clean up ugly and inefficient stylesheet
